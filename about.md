# LikeBaitExterminator

Replaces like-baiting comments with text of your choice. RobTop's comments are exempt, because he's RobTop.

You have two options: replace the offending comment's text with your own, or mark it as spam (with a small chance of the "Show" button doing nothing).

To view the original comment's contents, simply toggle off the "Enabled" option within the mod's own settings.

Thanks to TechStudent10 and TheSillyDoggo for finding the right hooks and member fields to get this working.

Thanks to Alphalaneous and Prevter for helping find the cause of a super rare crash.

Mod name vaguely inspired by Hazbin Hotel.
